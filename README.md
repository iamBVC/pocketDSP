# pocketDSP
A pocket-sized DSP for audio applications.

This device consists in a STM32H732 MCU, 24bit 192kHz ADC/DAC with high SiNAD, low noise opamp buffers, 3.5mm stereo jack input/output, 320x480 touchscreen display, li-ion battery and USB for battery recharging and Virtual COM Port.

Connect an audio input and create your own custom FX preset by selecting various standalone effects such as reverb, delay, phaser, IIR/FIR filters via the touchscreen display.
It's possible to receive and send audio data through the USB interface at 48Mbit/s to use the device as a HiFi sound card.
